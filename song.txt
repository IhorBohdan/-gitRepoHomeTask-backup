Staring at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing, floating, down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We're gonna sweep this under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

With you in the middle
With you in the middle
