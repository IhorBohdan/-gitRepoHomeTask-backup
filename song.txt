Staring at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing, floating, down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We're gonna sweep this under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

With you in the middle
With you in the middle

Lying down beside you, was going through your head
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
I might just hope for thinking, feelings, I can't tell
This gut feeling I'm tryna gain, I feel it well
I hope we find our missing pieces, I'm just chill
We're gonna sweep it under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to keep building a new world for us two
With you in the middle

With you in the middle
With you in the middle
With you
You
